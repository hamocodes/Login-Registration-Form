Login-Registration Form is a simple, functional web application built using HTML and CSS that provides an intuitive interface for login and registration.

Key Features:
  -Responsive Design (HTML & CSS): The layout is structured using HTML5 elements with CSS for responsive design, making the form adaptable to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

  -Minimalist UI (HTML & CSS): The clean and minimalistic design is achieved by combining semantic HTML tags and CSS for a clear, professional appearance. Input fields and labels are neatly aligned for ease of use.

  -Interactive Elements (CSS): CSS is used to style the buttons, with hover effects and transitions for enhanced user interaction. This provides visual feedback when users interact with the buttons, making the form more dynamic.
  
  =Form Validation (HTML): Basic HTML5 form validation attributes (like required, type="email") ensure users submit correct information before proceeding with login or registration.

  -User Experience: Placeholder text in the input fields guides users through the form, making it easy to understand and complete the required actions.
